## **Module 8 Use HTTPS**

# Introduction Page
This project is designed to delve deeper into understanding Javascript basics, Unit Test and ES6 that we will use in creating our own Data Service Application and API through MySQL databases and complex queries through the development of your own database representing a collection of data.

In this module, we are focused on enhancing the website's user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). By improving the UI, we are creating a more visually appealing and intuitive design, making it easier for users to navigate the website. Organizing the code better not only improves maintainability but also ensures a smoother development process. Ultimately, these enhancements lead to a more enjoyable and seamless experience for users when they interact with the API to create, read, update, and delete tasks. 
I also wrote jasmine tests. To run jasmine test:

# Create Test and create Report
- Download OpenSSL for windows: https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
- Install Win64OpenSSL_Light-3_4_1.msi and check version to make sure it is installed correctly: `openssl version`
- Run: `node .\server\get_keys.js`. This will generate key.pfx, cert.pem, and key.pem in server/ssl
