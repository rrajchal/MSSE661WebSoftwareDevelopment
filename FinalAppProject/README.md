# Nepalese Game Portal – A Fun Online Experience

## Introduction
I propose to create a web application titled “Nepalese Game Portal – A Fun Online Experience.” This application will be a gaming portal where users can sign up, log in, and enjoy various Nepalese games. In addition to offering an engaging gaming experience, this portal will provide information about various games played in Nepal. This will offer users a comprehensive and culturally rich understanding of Nepalese gaming traditions. Guests without login credentials can view basic content about games but will not have access to detailed game information or the ability to play games.

## Problem Statement
Nepal boasts a rich and diverse cultural heritage, which includes a variety of traditional games. Many of these games are unique to Nepal and reflect its cultural nuances and historical significance. However, several challenges exist:
- **Lack of Online Availability:** Not all traditional Nepalese games are available to play online. This limits their accessibility and the ability for a broader audience to experience and enjoy them.
- **Unique Games:** Some Nepalese games are unique and are not played or recognized internationally. These games often have distinct rules and play styles that are not widely known outside Nepal.
- **Common Games with Different Names:** Some Nepalese games share similarities with international games but have different names and slight variations in rules. This can lead to confusion and a lack of recognition.
- **Inadequate Documentation:** Many traditional Nepalese games are not documented properly. The rules, history, and cultural significance of these games are often passed down orally, leading to inconsistent and incomplete information.
- **Cultural Preservation:** There is a need to preserve and promote these traditional games to ensure they remain a vital part of Nepalese culture for future generations.

## User Authentication
- **Sign Up:** Users can register by providing the necessary information.
- **Login:** Users can access detailed game information and play games.
- **Encryption:** Ensure secure storage of passwords in encrypted form.

## Game Listing and Details
- **Game List:** Display a list of all available games.
- **Game Details:** Provide detailed information about each game to logged-in users.

## Profile Management
- **User:** Allow users to update their profile, including username and password.
- **Admin:** Managers can view and edit all users and their profiles. Managers can also modify game content.

## Game Development
- **Simple Games:** Include at least one simple game (such as Tic-Tac-Toe or a card game) that users can play.
- **Future Expansion:** Plan to extend the application with more games after gaining more knowledge from advanced classes.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, JSON or XML
- **Server:** `http://localhost:3000` (web) and `http://localhost:3001` (data)
- **Database:** MySQL (or any other relational database)
- **Security:** Password encryption using bcrypt
- **Testing:** Unit testing

## Conclusion
This project aims to create an engaging and secure online gaming portal that highlights Nepalese games. Through this project, I will apply the concepts learned in this course, such as web document structure, authentication flows, form validation, and server-side programming. The application will be a foundation for future enhancements and additional game development.
