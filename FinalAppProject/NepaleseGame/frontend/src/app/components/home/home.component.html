    <h2>Nepalese Game Portal â€“ A Fun Online Experience</h2>
    <p>
      This application will be a gaming portal where users can sign up, log in,
      and enjoy various Nepalese games. In addition to offering an engaging gaming
      experience, this portal will provide information about various games played
      in Nepal. This will offer users a comprehensive and culturally rich
      understanding of Nepalese gaming traditions. Guests without login
      credentials can view basic content about games but will not have access to
      detailed game information or the ability to play games.
